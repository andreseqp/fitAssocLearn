	abstract = {Reversal learning assays are commonly used across a wide range of taxa to investigate associative learning and behavioural flexibility. In serial reversal learning, the reward contingency in a binary discrimination is reversed multiple times. Performance during serial reversal learning varies greatly at the interspecific level, as some animals adopt a rule-based strategy that enables them to switch quickly between reward contingencies. A larger relative brain size, generating enhanced learning ability and increased behavioural flexibility, has been proposed to be an important factor underlying this variation. Here, we experimentally tested this hypothesis at the intraspecific level. We used guppies (Poecilia reticulata) artificially selected for small and large relative brain size, with matching differences in neuron number, in a serial reversal learning assay. We tested 96 individuals over 10 serial reversals and found that learning performance and memory were predicted by brain size, whereas differences in efficient learning strategies were not. We conclude that variation in brain size and neuron number is important for variation in learning performance and memory, but these differences are not great enough to cause the larger differences in efficient learning strategies observed at higher taxonomic levels., Summary: Relative brain size affects differences in advanced learning ability in small- and large-brained female guppies; however, regardless of brain size, they do not learn a generalized rule from earlier experience.},

	abstract = {Measures of cognitive performance, derived from psychometric tasks, have yielded important insights into the factors governing cognitive variation. However, concerns remain over the robustness of these measures, which may be susceptible to non-cognitive factors such as motivation and persistence. Efforts to quantify short-term repeatability of cognitive performance have gone some way to address this, but crucially the long-term repeatability of cognitive performance has been largely overlooked. Quantifying the long-term repeatability of cognitive performance provides the opportunity to determine the stability of cognitive phenotypes and the potential for selection to act on them. To this end, we quantified long-term repeatability of cognitive performance in wild Australian magpies over a three-year period. Cognitive performance was repeatable in two out of four cognitive tasks—associative learning and reversal-learning performance was repeatable, but spatial memory and inhibitory control performance, although trending toward significance, was not. Measures of general cognitive performance, obtained from principal components analyses carried out on each cognitive test battery, were highly repeatable. Together, these findings provide evidence that at least some cognitive phenotypes are stable, which in turn has important implications for our understanding of cognitive evolution.},

	abstract = {Cognitive flexibility may be necessary for animals facing changing conditions and has long been tested by the reversal learning paradigm. However, while this paradigm is typically based on training animals to discriminate between a rewarding and nonrewarding stimulus and then reversing their roles, under natural conditions animals usually face more than one set of two stimuli. Here, we addressed these potential intricacies by studying the reversal learning of house sparrows, Passer domesticus, in a two-set task. Sparrows previously trained as either colour or shape specialists exhibited different reversal dynamics: While colour discrimination was acquired faster than shape discrimination, shape specialists, including those reaching perfect preference of the rewarding shape, reversed faster than colour specialists. The reversal success of shape specialists was also less variable than that of colour specialists. Additionally, despite being slower, during the reversal, colour specialists sampled shapes more than shape specialists sampled colours. These results suggest that (1) when comparing different reversal tests, significant differences in reversal behaviour may be explained by the type of learned stimulus (e.g. shape versus colour) rather than by differences in cognitive flexibility and (2) under realistic conditions of multiple foraging options, preferences that are difficult to reverse (and typically viewed as indicating low cognitive flexibility) may nevertheless facilitate an ecologically flexible shift to novel food types. Finally, our results also demonstrate that a two-set (multiple-cue) experimental design may help to tease apart some of the different processes underlying reversal behaviour and cognitive flexibility.},

	abstract = {Behavioural flexibility allows an animal to adapt its behaviour in response to changes in the environment. Research conducted in primates, rodents and domestic fowl suggests greater behavioural persistence and reduced behavioural flexibility in males. We investigated sex differences in behavioural flexibility in fish by comparing male and female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in a reversal learning task. Fish were first trained on a colour discrimination, which was learned equally rapidly by males and females. However, once the reward contingency was reversed, females were better at inhibiting the previous response and reached criterion twice as fast as males. When reward reversing was repeated, males gradually reduced the number of errors, and the two sexes had a comparable performance after four reversals. We suggest that sex differences in behavioural flexibility in guppies can be explained in terms of the different roles that males and females play in reproduction.},

	abstract = {Cognitive ageing is the general process when certain mental skills gradually deteriorate with age. Across species, there is a pattern of a slower brain structure degradation rate in large-brained species. Hence, having a larger brain might buffer the impact of cognitive ageing and positively affect survival at older age. However, few studies have investigated the link between relative brain size and cognitive ageing at the intraspecific level. In particular, experimental data on how brain size affects brain function also into higher age is largely missing. We used 288 female guppies (Poecilia reticulata), artificially selected for large and small relative brain size, to investigate variation in colour discrimination and behavioural flexibility, at 4–6, 12 and 24 months of age. These ages are particularly interesting since they cover the life span from sexual maturation until maximal life length under natural conditions. We found no evidence for a slower cognitive ageing rate in large-brained females in neither initial colour discrimination nor reversal learning. Behavioural flexibility was predicted by large relative brain size in the youngest group, but the effect of brain size disappeared with increasing age. This result suggests that cognitive ageing rate is faster in large-brained female guppies, potentially due to the faster ageing and shorter lifespan in the large-brained selection lines. It also means that cognition levels align across different brain sizes with older age. We conclude that there are cognitive consequences of ageing that vary with relative brain size in advanced learning abilities, whereas fundamental aspects of learning can be maintained throughout the ecologically relevant life span.},

	abstract = {Abstract Two species of fish were tested in a serial reversal learning task using two dimensional objects varying in colour and/or form. After reaching the learning criterion (LC) in the original discrimination task, individuals reversed for up to ten times, i.e., stimulus association was switched and animals rewarded for choosing the stimulus that had not been rewarded in the previous learning phase. This was conducted using the two stimuli green diamond (S+) vs. red square (S−) for the training of eight cichlids, and black star (S+) vs. black circle (S−) for the training of seven bamboo sharks. All fifteen animals completed the initial training phase and reversed successfully at least three times, indicating an ability to forsake a previously learned stimulus association in favour of a new one. Sharks, but not cichlids, also showed a decrease in the number of sessions needed to reach LC with an increase in the number of reversals conducted, showing that some sort of learning strategy, i.e., rule learning, had been applied. Animals that improve their performance within such learning paradigms are considered to possess more behavioural flexibility and advanced cognitive abilities than those who do not. More flexibility could specifically aid species living in complex habitats, social groups and subjected to changing environmental conditions.},
