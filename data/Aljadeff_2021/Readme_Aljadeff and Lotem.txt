File: stage1_session1-2_training
Description: Choices of color and shape specialists during training

File: stage2a_session1-4_pre-reversal
Description: Choices of color and shape specialists on a multiple-cue grid before reversal (sessions 1-4)

File: stage2b_session5-6_pre-reversal
Description: Choices of color and shape specialists on a multiple-cue grid before reversal (sessions 5-6)

File: stage3_session1-4_post-reversal
Description: Choices of color and shape specialists on a multiple-cue grid after reversal (sessions 1-4) 

For all files the columns are the following:
  
Column heading			Description
Sparrow 			Sparrow identity
Cohort				Experimental cohort (1-6). Cohorts are replications of the experiment. 
Group				The group to which it belongs(color specialist group, shape specialist group,mixed specialist group= with color and shape specialists)
Specialization                  The type of specialization on which it was trained (color or shape)
Session                         Experimental session. Sessions are sequential social foraging periods on a grid with replenished food reward.    
RC                              The number of choices for the rewarding color in intact wells (reward was initially available with a probability of 0.5,Intact wells are ones that had not been already pecked by any of the sparrows, including the focal bird) 
NRC                             The number of choices for the non-rewarding color in intact wells.
RS 	                        The number of choices for the rewarding shape in intact wells (reward was initially available with a probability of 0.5,Intact wells are ones that had not been already pecked by any of the sparrows, including the focal bird)
NRS                             The number of choices for the non-rewarding shape in intact wells.
